# CNN_FromScratch
## Course Project for COL341 (Machine Learning)   | Spring '23 IIT Delhi 
## By: Divyanshu Agarwal (2020CS10343)
This repo involves the Jupyter notebooks for the below-mentioned machine learning models : 
- Implementation of CNN from Scratch using just Numpy
- Another implementation using PyTorch. This involves experiments with various hyper paramters like batch size, number of epochs, optimiser etc
  
[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset was used for the purpose of training, test and validation
## Results
- Achieved **62.4%** accuracy from the scratch implementation
- Achieved **71.8%** accuracy from the Pytorch implementation
- To see detailed results of experiments I ran in the Pytorch implementation, check out this [report](reportA4.pdf)
