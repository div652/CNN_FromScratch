# CNN From Scratch
## Course Project for COL341 (Machine Learning)   | Spring '23 IIT Delhi 
## By: Divyanshu Agarwal (2020SC10343)
This repo involves my Jupyter notebooks for the below-mentioned machine learning models: 
- Implementation of CNN from Scratch using just Numpy
- Another implementation using PyTorch. This involves experiments with various hyper parameters like batch size, number of epochs, optimiser etc.
The dataset used was the CIFAR-10 dataset
## Results
- Achieved **62.4%** accuracy from the scratch implementation
- Achieved **71.8%** accuracy using the PyTorch implementation
- To see the detailed results of the experiments performed in the pytorch implementation see this [report](reportA4.pdf)
